FOPAC
========================
FOPAC provides fast and easy-to-setup private chat rooms. After you create a new room, you may generate Permits, a unique access links to your room, which you then may give to desired participants in the communication. All members of the room (except moderators specified by you) can see only 10 characters long randomly generated nicknames. When you don't have a need for the room anymore, you may destroy it along with all messages and permits or just stop using it for a week. All rooms inactive for seven or more days are automatically destroyed. There is no registration.

FOPAC is optimized for use in the latest versions of Google Chrome (or most WebKit-based browsers) and Mozilla Firefox. Enabling JavaScript is required and enabling Adobe Flash is recommended.

FOPAC is powered by [Symfony 2.3][1], [Bootstrap 2.3][2], [Font Awesome 3.2][3], [CSS Browser Selector][4], [CryptoJS 3.1][5] and [jQuery 1.10][6] with plugins [ZeroClipboard][7], [Timeago][8], [Linkify][9] and [Emoji][10]. FOPAC's code base is open-sourced and licensed under the MIT License. 

FOPAC is one man project. Like all one man projects, it is susceptible to errors and shortcomings that were unnoticed by its developer. All bug reports, suggestions, improvements, constructive reviews and questions are more than welcome.
